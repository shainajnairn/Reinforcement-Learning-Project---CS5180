## Possible improvements in Algorithm or environment.

### Environment

- Variable Mass and Fuel Consumption:

Current: The rocket’s mass and moment of inertia are fixed.
Modification: Implement fuel burn dynamics, where the mass decreases over time as fuel is consumed. This would require recalculating the moment of inertia dynamically, affecting both linear and rotational motion.

- More Realistic Aerodynamics:

- Current: Air resistance is modeled with a simple constant drag proportional to velocity.
- Modification: Use a quadratic drag model (drag ∝ velocity²) and incorporate factors like air density, cross-sectional area, and a drag coefficient. You could also simulate wind effects or turbulence, adding random disturbances or directional forces.

- Engine and Nozzle Dynamics:
Current: The engine thrust and nozzle angle are adjusted instantly based on the action.
Modification: Introduce delays or limits to the engine's response. For example, simulate the inertia of the nozzle, where changes to the gimbal have a lag, or incorporate throttling limits to the thrust.

- Detailed Ground and Landing Dynamics:
Current: The environment uses simple checks to determine landing success or crashes.
Modification: Implement a more detailed ground interaction model. This could include bounce effects, landing gear dynamics, and impact forces to better simulate what happens upon touchdown.

- Environmental Variability:
Current: The simulation world is static aside from the rocket’s dynamics.
Modification: Add elements like varying terrain, wind fields, or even weather effects that change over time. This would provide additional challenges and a more realistic setting.

- Sensor Noise and Delays:
Current: The simulation provides perfect state information.
Modification: Introduce noise or delays in the state observations to mimic real-world sensor imperfections, making control more challenging and realistic.
